# 2020 General Election Survey Analysis

## Overview
This project revolves around the analysis of a dataset containing 1,000 survey responses collected after the 2020 General Election. The dataset captures crucial voter information, including their presidential candidate choice (Biden, Trump, third party, or did not vote) among other characteristics.

## Objective
The primary goal of this analysis is to utilize the survey data to optimize targeted mailing strategies for future voter engagement and fundraising efforts. Specifically, we aim to identify potential donors by analyzing their past donation behaviors and voting patterns. An illustrative example of this targeted approach could involve soliciting donations from individuals who contributed generously to DFL groups in 2020, while excluding non-donors from the mailing list.

## Methodology
To achieve our objectives, we propose the development and comparison of at least two predictive models. These models will be evaluated based on their predictive accuracy to ensure the effectiveness of the targeted mailers. The following steps outline our proposed methodology:

1. **Model Development:** Build a minimum of two predictive models using the survey data. These models will aim to predict voter behavior and potential donation activity based on historical patterns and responses.

2. **Model Comparison:** Compare the predictive accuracies of the developed models. This comparison will involve analyzing various performance metrics to determine the most effective model for our objectives.

3. **Uncertainty Measurement:** Provide a measure of uncertainty for the accuracies reported for each model. This step is crucial to ensure confidence in the models' predictive capabilities.

4. **Documentation:** Thoroughly document the methodologies used in model development and comparison. This documentation should be detailed enough to enable future data analysts to understand, replicate, and possibly build upon the work done.

## Future Implications
The insights gained from this analysis will directly inform our strategy for targeted mailer distribution, potentially increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our voter engagement and fundraising efforts. Moreover, this project will lay the groundwork for future data analysis initiatives within our organization, promoting a data-driven approach to decision-making.
